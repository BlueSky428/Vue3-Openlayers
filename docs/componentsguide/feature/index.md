# ol-feature

> A container for geometry

`ol-feature` can be used together with `ol-vector-layer` and `ol-source-vector` to add GeoJSON features to the map.
The `ol-feature` must contain a single child element (Geometry), e. .g `ol-geom-point` and a `ol-style` which defined the style for the Geometry.
If you want to display multiple Geometries, you need to add multiple `ol-feature`'s.
